<body><h1>Inkscape vs. GIMP</h1><br /><h2>Which One Should You Use?</h2><br /><br />• Both are FOSS<br /><br /><h2>About Inkscape</h2><br /><br />• An open source drawing tool for creating and editing <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</strong>. Most similar to Adobe Illustrator<br />• Graphics drawn within Inkscape are <em>formula or code based</em>, and thus can be infinitely <strong>scaled up or down without any loss of quality</strong><br />• Can import raster or bitmap graphics for use within vector designs<br />• Inkscape is not a photo editor<br />• File extensions: .SVG and .EPS<br />• Can export to code documents like .HTML, as well as to animation files like .SIF.<br /><br /><h2>When Should Inkscape be Used?</h2><br /><br />• When drawing shapes, curves, and text; Designing a logo<br />• Good for printing<br /><br /><h2>Who Should Use Inkscape?</h2><br /><br />• Graphic designers, marketers, business professionals, and vector artists<br />• Anyone who needs to print digital designs ((unless you are printing photos)<br />• Web designers who prefer to directly code their designs into their websites<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>About GIMP</h2><br /><br />• A multi-platform photo manipulation tool<br />• Uses <strong>raster graphics</strong> or a bitmap for display and editing purposes, meaning everything is displayed as pixels in a rectangular pixel grid<br />• GIMP is most similar to Photoshop<br />• Can open and export files in .XCF (GIMP’s native file format – which allows you to save and reopen works that contain layers), .JPEG, .PNG, .GIF, and even .PSD (Photoshop Document)<br /><br /><img src="images\175-1.png" alt="images\175-1.png" /><br /><br /><h2>When Should GIMP Be Used?</h2><br /><br />• When editing or manipulating photos and when free-hand drawing<br />• Can also be used for digital painting and pixel art (which is used in game design and other applications)<br />• Also capable of performing certain graphic design tasks but the graphic design elements are not scalable and often have “jagged” or “pixelated” edges when looked at closely<br /><br /><h2>Who Should Use GIMP?</h2><br /><br />• Photographers, digital painters and artists, and game designers<br />• Web designers with little to no coding experience and who are not concerned with scaling their designs<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>Using Both Programs Together</h2><br /><br />• For example, you can edit your photos in GIMP and then import the finished JPEG into Inkscape to use within a vector design<br />• You can create a vector design and import it into GIMP to be used in a photo (such as a logo watermark to add to the bottom)<br />• You can create crisp, clean vector-based icons to use on a website in Inkscape, and then import that design file into GIMP to adjust the pixel resolution and compress as a JPEG for better performance on the web<br />• You can also create things like GIMP Palette files (.GPL) within Inkscape and import those palettes to use in your GIMP projects<br /><br /><br /><p align="center"><img src="images\home.png" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></body></html>
