<body><h1>Networking Basics and Software Defined Networks (SDN)</h1><br /><br /><h2>What is a network?</h2><br />• A network consists of <strong>host devices</strong> such as computers, mobile devices, and printers that are connected by <strong>networking devices</strong> such as switches and routers. The network enables the devices to <strong>communicate</strong> with one another and <strong>share data</strong><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>Understand Device Compatibility with Networking</h2><br /><h3>Why do some devices work on networks and others do not?</h3><br /> <br />• To connect to a network, each of your devices should have a <strong>Network Interface (NIC) card</strong><br />• You can connect to a wired network with an <strong>Ethernet cable</strong> through <strong>RJ-45 port</strong><br />• Each NIC card has a unique <strong>Media Access Control (MAC) address</strong> that identifies the physical device, also known as a physical address<br />   ◇ A MAC address is six bytes long, in hexadecimal format. The first three bytes are the vendor ID, and the last three bytes are the NIC ID<br /><br /><img src="images\150-1.png" alt="images\150-1.png" /><br /><br />• A NIC card also has a <strong>Internet Protocol Address (IPv4) address</strong>. You can configure a <strong>static address</strong>, or the network card can get a <strong>dynamically-assigned address</strong> from a <strong>DHCP</strong> service on the network<br />• An IP address consists of four values, called <strong>octets</strong>, that range from 0 to 255 and are separated from each other by dots. An IP address must be unique on the network.<br /><br /><img src="images\150-2.png" alt="images\150-2.png" /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>Understand How Devices Find Each Other</h2><br /><br /><h3>Scenario #1: On Different Subnet</h3><br /><br /><img src="images\150-3.png" alt="images\150-3.png" /><br /><br />• The student computer will send the message request to its <strong>default gateway IP</strong>, belonging to the router. The network switch and router complete the following processes to send the data<br /><br />   1) MAC Address table<br />      ▪ The switch receives the message request and looks in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base">MAC Address Table</a> for the MAC address associated with the router IP<br />      ▪ If the switch locates the MAC address, it sends the student message to the port connected to the router for further processing<br />      ▪ f the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast_flood">floods</a> the request to all ports<br />   2) ARP Cache<br />      ▪ The router receives the message request and looks in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_cache">ARP cache</a> for the MAC address associated with IP<br />      ▪ If the router locates the MAC address and other identifying information, it sends the student message to the instructor computer<br />      ▪ If the router does not have the MAC address in its cache, it initiates an <strong>ARP Request</strong> to look for the IP address on all network devices<br />         - If one of the devices has that IP address, the device sends an <strong>ARP response</strong> that identifies itself and includes the MAC address. The router then passes the message to that device<br />         - if no devices connected to that router have a matching IP address, the router will <strong>drop the request</strong><br />   3) MAC Address table<br />      ▪ The switch receives the message request from the router and looks in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base">MAC Address Table</a> for the MAC address associated with the instructor's computer<br />      ▪ If the switch locates the MAC address, it sends the student message to the port connected to the computer<br />      ▪ If the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast_flood">floods</a> the request to all ports<br /><br /><h3>Scenario #2: On Same Subnet</h3><br /><br /><img src="images\150-4.png" alt="images\150-4.png" /><br /><br />• This simple network does not include a router, but may connect the devices via a switch or a hub<br />• To be "on the same segment" means that an IPv4 address can be found without the need to route to another network segment<br /><br />   1) ARP cache<br />      ▪ The user computer looks in its ARP cache for the MAC address associated<br />      ▪ If the computer locates the MAC address and other identifying information, it sends the data to the MAC address of the printer<br />      ▪ If the computer does not have the MAC address in its table, it initiates an <strong>ARP request</strong><br />         - The user computer sends an ARP Request to look for the IP address<br />         - The printer receives the request and sends an <strong>ARP Response</strong> that identifies itself and includes the MAC address<br />         - The computer sends the data to the MAC address of the printer<br />   2) MAC address table<br />      ▪ The switch receives the message request and looks in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base">MAC Address Table</a> for the MAC address associated with the printer<br />      ▪ If the switch locates the MAC address, it sends the message out the port connected to the printer<br />      ▪ If the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast_flood">floods</a> the request to all ports<br /> <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>Hub vs. Switch</h2><br /><br />• Hubs do not have an ARP cache and cannot use ARP<br />• Hubs always broadcast data to all ports, which can saturate the network, consume bandwidth<br />• Many switches have a feature called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Microsegmentation">microsegmentation</a> that provides the same bandwidth to all connected devices<br />• With microsegmentation, network traffic flows smoothly without <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/collision">collisions</a><br />• Switches often provide many configuration options, while hubs offer little or no configuration<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>What are switches, routers, and interfaces and how are they configured?</h2><br /><br /><br /><h3>Switch characteristics and behavior</h3><br /><br /><img src="images\150-5.png" alt="images\150-5.png" /><br /><br />• A switch is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)</a> device, so most interfaces do not have IPv4 addresses<br />• Switches have the following characteristics:<br />   ◇ RJ45 ports connect to other devices such as a router, switches, and other network hosts (e.g., computers and printers). Each port has a configurable software interface<br />   ◇ ARP determines with which device it should exchange data<br />   ◇ <strong>Microsegmentation</strong> prevents network data <strong>collisions</strong> and improves traffic flow<br />   ◇ Interfaces can be configured to create networks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN">Virtual LANs (VLANs)</a><br />   ◇ No IP addresses are present in the configuration<br /><br /><br /><h3>Router characteristics and behavior</h3><br /><br /><img src="images\150-6.png" alt="images\150-6.png" /><br /><br />• A router is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">Layer 3 (Network Layer)</a> device. Most of its interfaces have IPv4 addresses<br />• Routers have the following characteristics:<br />   ◇ RJ45 ports connect to other routers or switches. Each port has a configurable software interface.<br />   ◇ A <strong>routing table</strong> determines which switch or router should receive data. It routes data to the proper network device.<br />   ◇ Interfaces and other features such as routing tables, and network address translation can be configured by an administrator. Configuration is not covered in this Learning Lab<br />• Each interface has an IP address in the configuration<br /><br /><h3>Interfaces</h3><br /><br />• Each physical RJ45 portal has at least one interface that can be configured<br />• A network engineer can configure and activate or deactivate an interface via a terminal or command line interface<br />• Configure virtual interfaces, trunk ports, virtual LANs, attaching policies and functionality to various interfaces, and more<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><h2>Understand SDN and REST in the Context of Networking</h2><br /><br /><h3>Software-Defined Networks (SDN)</h3><br /><br />• A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">Software Defined Network (SDN)</a> uses networking software to configure the network<br />• SDN separated the data plane and control plane to enable completion of network configuration and decisions through a remote control plane<br /><br /><br /><h3>Representational State Transfer (REST)</h3><br /><br />• Network engineers use software that connects to these APIs to configure switches and routers dynamically<p align="center"><img src="images\home.png" height="22" width="22">  <a href="index.html">Index</a></p></body></html>
